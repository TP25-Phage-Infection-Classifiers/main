    "# Decision on Sequence Type for Feature Development\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Using Only DNA Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Captures **regulatory elements** (promoters, enhancers, terminators)\n",
    "- Enables analysis of **nucleotide-level patterns** (e.g., GC content, CpG bias, motifs)\n",
    "- **Silent mutations** and **codon usage bias** can be informative\n",
    "- Sequence is **static** and not influenced by expression or translation efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Lacks direct **functional information** about encoded proteins\n",
    "- Cannot capture **structural or domain-level properties**\n",
    "- More **redundancy** due to synonymous codons\n",
    "- Less effective for tasks needing **functional prediction or homology detection**\n",

    "\n",

    "## 2. Using Only Protein Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Directly reflects **biological function** (enzymatic activity, binding properties)\n",
    "- Richer alphabet (20 amino acids) allows for **more diverse feature representations**\n",
    "- Better suited for **evolutionary** and **homology-based** analysis\n",
    "- Many tools available for **domain prediction**, **structure modeling**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Does not capture **non-coding regulatory information**\n",
    "- Misses **silent mutations** and codon-level nuances\n",
    "- Requires accurate **gene annotation** and **translation**\n",
    "- Cannot model features related to **epigenetics** or **transcriptional regulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Using a Combination of DNA and Protein Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Integrates **functional** and **regulatory** layers of information\n",
    "- Enables **multi-scale feature design**: from motifs to domains\n",
    "- Ideal for modeling **complex traits** (e.g., lifecycle strategy, host interaction)\n",
    "- Allows **cross-validation** of predicted genes (sequence + function support)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Increased **model complexity** and **feature dimensionality**\n",
    "- Requires careful **feature integration** to avoid redundancy or overfitting\n",
    "- May reduce **interpretability** if features are not well-separated\n",
    "- Higher **computational cost** and design effort\n",

    "## -> Decision: **Combination of DNA and Protein Sequences**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justification: Why Use Both DNA and Protein Sequences?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using both DNA and protein sequences enables us to capture complementary aspects of phage biology: regulation from DNA and function from proteins. DNA features (e.g., GC content, CpG bias, motifs) help explain transcriptional regulation and host interaction, while protein features (e.g., amino acid composition, domains) relate directly to gene function and evolutionary conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes well-annotated genes (via GFF3), allowing reliable translation to protein sequences. Additionally, RNA-Seq expression data can be linked to both DNA and protein features, supporting a multi-layered analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination is particularly useful for complex tasks such as lifecycle prediction, functional classification, and host adaptation, where both regulatory context and functional content are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the combined approach improves biological interpretability and supports more robust models without discarding any critical layer of information.\n",
